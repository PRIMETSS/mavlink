ByteArrayUtil Missing:

    Fix:    https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink/issues/151
	This fix is done INSIDE the pyMavLink GitProject, which is inside MAVLink git repo, so changes here do not get pushed up and get a pymavlin---project-dirty. OK
    Becuase it is another repo, EACH NEW BRANCH this modification will need to be made, as its a none merged PR
